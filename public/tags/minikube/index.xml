      <description>Introduction The content curation process for this blog post exhausted me, and the reason is a distraction. Read and enjoy the funny story! I made a lot of trial and error before sharing it with you all. My previous blog post discussed using Dapr on Minikube with a PowerShell app. You can refer to the link below to learn about the use case of state store component

      <description>Introduction I have recorded the demonstration of spinning up the full-stack application built using PowerShell (Pode &amp;amp; PSHTML). Feel free to leave your comments
Disclaimer This blog post is the output of my learning on Docker, MySQL, docker-compose, and MiniKube. So, please skip asking why not native or alternatives?. I am sharing it as a blog because of the ask that I have seen it in the REDDIT. I am an automation engineer with a decent experience in the cloud, not a software developer.</description>
